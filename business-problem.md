# Business Problem
## Social food ordering app
In workplaces, employees have lunch hours where they can have a break and get something to eat before going back to work. Employees can do either of the following:
* Use the workplace's in-house catering service.
* Bring the food from home and eat inside.
* Go out and eat at dine-in restaurants.
* Go out get their food and come back to the workplace and eat.

We want to create an app that helps the employees place an order with a nearby restaurant, pay online, and go pick up the food when it is ready while avoiding staying in the line.

For the app to be successful we should incentivize both consumers and merchants to participate. Restaurant owners need to be convinced that they will get more customers and hence more profit. Customers need to be convinced that they have a good amount of choices nearby to use the app. 

For the start, we need to talk to restaurant owners to participate. This is an expensive operation because we need to give them hardware, spend hours selling the product, and use manpower to help them with operations. Some of these restaurants may churn if there are not enough customers and for our company, it doesn't make sense to invest in restaurants that don't get enough customers to cover initial investment costs. 

To have a better chance of success, we want to target the area with a dense amount of restaurants, to begin with. This has multiple benefits:
* Group of restaurants together shows high demand in the area. If we convince these restaurants to participate, we probably get a good amount of users on our platform.
* Sending salespeople to talk to the restaurant owners is costly. If restaurants are placed close together we can make better use of our sales team and send them to cover more restaurants in each sales pitch tour.
* Operations cost as well as sales cost is high. We have to send equipment and install it for our merchants. The closer these merchants are, the more we can provide our services each day.

Our goal is to find target neighborhoods in each city that are good candidates to start expanding our business. Neighborhoods with a dense number of restaurants are a good start for us.
